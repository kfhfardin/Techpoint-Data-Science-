    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will create a sample 10-week timetable of major events for the 100+ Techpoint interns for the entire length internship period. My initial starting date of the internship is 16th October 2021 (Saturday) and it will end on the 26th of December,2021. I am keeping the dates recent to access a greater number of more recent events as events of Summer 2022 are not yet that well documented. However, the code can easily be adjusted to do it for the summer period as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am assuming that most interns would work on typical Monday to Friday (9-5) work hours. In that train of thought, I decided to hold the group dinner on Friday and events on either Saturday or Sunday (preferably Saturday). The first dinner would be on the 22nd of October and every Friday afterward until the 26th of December while the first event would be held either on 30th-31st of September and every biweekly period until the 26th of December.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it more convenient, I collected data for restaurants and events separately. As for the events(except for the conference), I gathered data on all events on the already decided dates from websites that I thought provided the most information. I collected data on the restaurants from a specific website that provided information on the capacity of each Restaurant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I used the data to find the best co-worker space. To do that I calculated the distance between each restaurant and event location with both co-working space and housing. After that, I built a sample 10-week timetable based on events that remained after the data analysis is completed. I based my final choice of co-working space on the idea that the co-working space that is the closest to both the living space and most events is the best choice. "

In the end, I decided to make it simple-the closest to the main housing unit (IUPUI)each event can be the better. If two events were the same distance from housing then an order of listing would come into play and the one listed first would be chosen. This made sense since the transportation of 100 people into far places in consecutive weeks would be a logistical nightmare. \n",

    "As can be seen clearly from the data on average Launch Indy is the closest to both the housing as well as the restaurant and the events. Since my analysis of an optimal Coworking place is based on the idea of least travel, that makes Launch Indy the best Coworking Space out of the 5 options provided.\n",

    "Data Collection: I collected data using a web scraper called PurseHub.However, this meant that the data would not automatically adjust for different periods. Thus it would be optimal if an API could be used to collect the data so it adjusts automatically(I tried using Eventbrite API, however, they have stopped providing scarping options through date and location). Additionally, my data missed out on some important points like the capacity of each event as it was hard to get. Thus, a better model would incorporate a greater range of information about events and restaurants to carry out a more efficient analysis.\n",

    "Data Engineering: I think this was the most time-consuming part of my project. The continuous loops took quite a bit of time to run. However, the loops needed to find the distance(using Google API). Since I am not aware of any other way of doing it other than loops my options were limited even though the time complexity made the project very frustrating\n",

    "Data Analysis: This part of the project was perhaps the simplest which was surprising. I felt finding the average distance difference between the event(or restaurant) with house and event(or restaurant) with Coworking space was perhaps too simple but given the fact that the prompt was very open-ended, it was in my opinion suitable."
