Techpoint Data Science Work Sample Assessment </br>
The program uses data from various web sources to create an itinerary of the events and restaurants to visit based on customer preferences for a ten-week period.</br>
The program was built for a Work Sample assessment for a data science internship.</br>
Most of the code is written in Jupyter Notebook.</br>
The code file(Data Science Prompt(Main Code).ipynb) should explain the process behind the analysis performed.</br>
